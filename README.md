# TinyUrl
A Django implementation for a Url shorting service

This light weighted application creates substantially shorter urls for longer ones 
while being able to redirect users to the desinated page. The urls are intended for
being embedded in length limited posts such as Twitter or Weibo.

Index page: http://<server>/url/
Shortened url is in format: http://<server>/url/aBcDeF

This project was developed with Django 1.8.6.
